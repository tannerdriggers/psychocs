Welcome to the Sustained Attention to Response Task.

In this study you will be presented with a single digit (1-9) in varying sizes in the middle of the screen
for a short duration. The digit is followed by a crossed circle.

Your task is to
* press the <SPACEBAR> when you see any digit other than 3.
* don't do anything (don't press any key) when you see the digit 3. Just wait for the next digit.

Use the index finger of your dominant hand when responding (e.g. if you are left-handed, use your left
index finger to press the <SPACEBAR>).

It is important to be accurate and fast in this study.



*PRESS <SPACEBAR> TO BEGIN THE TASK*
